        <h1>Reserve the Library Room</h1>
        <p>Our library room is a great space for meetings, study sessions, and small club events. Groups
          of 4-12 people are able to reserve the library room for a maximum of two hours. Bordertown reserves the right to cancel any library 
          reservation for any reason. Since this service is intended for groups, we require a minimum of four people per reservation. 
          Reserving for fewer than four people can result in losing the ability to reserve the library in the future.
