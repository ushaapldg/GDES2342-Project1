        <h2>It's always been about the people.</h2>
        <div class="mission-statement-description">
          <p>When Bordertown opened in 2004, it ran on inspiration and passion through all the inexperience and lessons learned when 
          starting a business.</p>
          <br>
          <p>But the unique location, and more importantly, the people who visited and the people who served them kept this place alive. 
            Both in customers and staff, Bordertown Coffee has been blessed by the thousands upon thousands who have experienced it.</p>
